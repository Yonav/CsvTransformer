# CSV-Transformer

This project automatically transforms csv files from one format to another and modifies the contents of the cells.

To use this, you would have to write your own configuration to declare how you want to transform and modify the csv.
The basic operations and models that can be used during the transformation can be seen in the model.csv folder.


## Disclaimer
This project was written for my own benefit. 

Herewith I transform CSV files generated by my bank or from my own created Notion format to my own created MoneyManagerEx format.

For this reason, comments and tests are written very sporadically.

Additionally, some of the names of the columns or descriptions of the map are in german.

If you have a question regarding the project, feel free to contact me.
